# MVCO_light_at_depth

Estimation of light environment at MVCO at 4m depth using data from:
radiometer casts and CTD casts

The various pieces are:
--Estimate attentuation coefficients (k's) from radiometer casts
---See if relationship between k and chlorophyll
---If so, see if relationship between fluorometer and cholorphyll data to be able to model light environment over entire timeseries from    fluorescence -> chl -> k -> light at depth

---Use density information to see if stratification would limit cells movement in the water column and if this would affect the amount of light they experience
