# MVCO_light_at_depth

Project that attempts to estimate what the light field at MVCO would be at 4m depth using data from:
radiometer casts

developing an attenuation model with corresponding chlorophyll data

linking fluorescence data to chlorophyll data and extrapolating chlorophyll data

Use extrapolations to estimate attenation year-round

Use density information to see if stratification would limit cells movement in the water column and if this would affect the amount of light they experience
